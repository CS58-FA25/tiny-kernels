FYI:

Makefile:   a sample makefile (set up to build and link your kernel)
template.c: a template for implementing LoadProgram

test/: some sample user-level programs for testing.  All of these should run correctly!
fancy/: some rather fancy user-level programs.  FYA

dot.gdbinit: if you're not using our VirtualBox instance, copy this to "~/.gdbinit"
